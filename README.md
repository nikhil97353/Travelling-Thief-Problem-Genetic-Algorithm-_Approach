# Genetic-Algorithm-approach-to-Travelling Thief Problem
The GECCO19 Traveling Thief Problem (TTP) combines two NP-hard problems - the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the Knapsack Problem (KNP). TSP focuses on finding the shortest distance for a traveling salesman to visit each city and return to the original city, while KNP focuses on maximizing the value of the thief's backpack while minimizing the backpack weight below the backpack weight capacity. This project will combine the two problems Optimize in order to obtain an optimal solution.4`   How to install the project
Dependencies: Ensure Python (with required libraries - matplotlib) is installed.

## How to Use the Project

### Code Execution:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TTP-Optimization.git
   cd TTP-Optimization
2. Run the provided Python script:
   ```bash
   evolutionary_algorithm.py


 
Conclusion:
The project utilized a Genetic Algorithm to solve the TSP with additional constraints. Several iterations and improvements were made to enhance the algorithm's performance in handling constraints while maximizing profits. The final implementation offers a trade-off between exploration and exploitation for an optimal solution.
