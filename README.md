# Genetic-Algorithm-approach-to-Travelling Thief Problem
Brief description
The GECCO19 Traveling Thief Problem (TTP) combines two NP-hard problems - the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the Knapsack Problem (KNP). TSP focuses on finding the shortest distance for a traveling salesman to visit each city and return to the original city, while KNP focuses on maximizing the value of the thief's backpack while minimizing the backpack weight below the backpack weight capacity. This project will combine the two problems Optimize in order to obtain an optimal solution.
How to install the project
Dependencies: Ensure Python (with required libraries - matplotlib) is installed.

How to use the project
Code Execution:
Run the provided Python script (python your_script.py).
Adjust parameters (population size, mutation rate, etc.) as needed.
Expected Output:
Visualization of city coordinates.
Console output showing each generation's best fitness.
Final best fitness and the corresponding optimal route visualization.

 
Conclusion:
The project utilized a Genetic Algorithm to solve the TSP with additional constraints. Several iterations and improvements were made to enhance the algorithm's performance in handling constraints while maximizing profits. The final implementation offers a trade-off between exploration and exploitation for an optimal solution.
